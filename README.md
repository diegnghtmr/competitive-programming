# 🚀 Competitive Programming Playground

🏆 Competitive Programming Enthusiast with a track record in ICPC, LeetCode, Codeforces and more. This repo showcases solutions crafted to sharpen **computational thinking** 🧠, strengthen **logic-math skills** 🔢, boost **problem solving** 🎯 and push **algorithmic efficiency** ⚡. Challenges are tackled both **individually** 👤 and **with teams** 👥, especially in ICPC-style contests. Developed on Fedora Linux 🐧 for a solid open-source environment.

## ⚡ Tech Stack
- **Warp Terminal** 💻 - a modern terminal that speeds up the workflow with built‑in command suggestions and multi-pane support.
- **Fedora Linux** 🐧 - the development OS powering these solutions.
- **Neovim (NVim)** ✨ - primary development environment tuned for competition speed (plugins, key mappings and macros galore).
